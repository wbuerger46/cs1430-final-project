function  spherical_image = spherical_conversion(img,f)
%    
%     Run spherical_conversion to prewarp the image into a spherical image
%     before stiching images together.

%     img:                the original image
%     f:                  the focal length the image was taken at (this is often in the image file EXIF data; let us know if you can't find it)
%     
%     spherical_image:    new spherical image
