\section*{Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is your project idea? \\
  Taking a set of 2D images of a space, we want to stich together the images using common feature points, and ultimately create a panoramic reconstruction of the whole space that a user can navigate through smoothly, as if they are moving within the space.

  \item What data have you collected? \\
  We've now each taken a set of images of a set, which we're using as our main data set!

  \item What software have you built or used?
  We are using numpy libraries!

  \item What has each team member contributed thus far?
  We've just started, so we've each contributed one set of images. We've also made a sketch of the project code, but we're planning to really dive in this week.

  \item What problems have you faced or still have to consider?
  We're still just starting to deal with how to optimize SIFT to work across a set of many images for optimal stiching. We're going to mess around with that this week!

  \item Is there anything that we can do to help? E.G., resources, equipment.
  Not as of now!
\end{itemize}
